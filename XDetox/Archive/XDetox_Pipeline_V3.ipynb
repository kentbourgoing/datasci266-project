If you set `num_examples`, the script writes a **subset file** under  \n","     `datasets/_subsets/{data_type}/...`  \n","   - This subset matches the format expected by `rewrite.rewrite_example.get_data()`.\n","\n","2. **Masking with DecompX**\n","\n","   - We use a RoBERTa toxicity classifier with DecompX to get **per-token toxicity importance**.\n","   - Tokens that push the prediction towards the toxic class are **replaced with `<mask>`**.\n","   - Masked sentences are saved as:\n","\n","     - `data/dexp_outputs/{output_folder}/{data_type}/DecompX{thresh}/masked_inputs.txt`\n","\n","   - Thresholds control how aggressively we mask:\n","\n","     - For a threshold value $\\tau$, higher $\\tau$ → **less masking**, lower $\\tau$ → **more masking**.\n","\n","3. **Generation with MaRCo (BART ensemble)**\n","\n","   For each masked input, we use an ensemble of BART models:\n","\n","   - **Base** model (generic BART).\n","   - **Expert** model (trained on non-toxic text).\n","   - **Anti-expert** model (trained on toxic text).\n","\n","   During generation, logits are combined as a **product-of-experts**:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\text{logits}_{\\text{ens}} = \\alpha_b \\cdot \\text{logits}_{\\text{base}}\n","   + \\alpha_e \\cdot \\text{logits}_{\\text{expert}}\n","   - \\alpha_a \\cdot \\text{logits}_{\\text{anti}}\n","   $$\n","\n","   where:\n","\n","   - $\\alpha_a$ controls how strongly we **push away** from toxic patterns.\n","   - $\\alpha_e$ controls how strongly we **pull towards** non-toxic patterns.\n","   - $\\alpha_b$ controls the influence of the base model.\n","\n","   Sampling is controlled by:\n","\n","   - `sample` (sampling vs greedy),\n","   - `top_k_gen`,\n","   - `top_p`,\n","   - `filter_p`,\n","   - `temperature`,\n","   - `rep_penalty`,\n","   - `max_length`.\n","\n","4. **DecompX-based reranking (inside `rewrite.rewrite_example`)**\n","\n","   When `ranking=True`:\n","\n","   - For each **input sentence**, the generation script samples `num_candidates` candidates.\n","   - For each candidate, it runs the DecompX toxicity model **again** and computes a scalar “toxicity importance” score for that output.\n","   - It then chooses the candidate with **lowest summed toxicity importance** (the “least toxic” according to DecompX).\n","\n","   This happens inside the `rewrite.rewrite_example` module via:\n","\n","   - `--ranking`\n","   - `--ranking_num_output {num_candidates}`\n","\n","5. **Evaluation**\n","\n","   If `run_eval=True`, the notebook calls `evaluation.evaluate_all` for each generation folder and computes:\n","\n","   - BERTScore (F1)\n","   - MeaningBERT\n","   - BLEU-4\n","   - Perplexity (orig / gen)\n","   - Toxicity (orig / gen)\n","   - Optionally percent toxic (if you keep those columns)\n","\n","   For each folder under:\n","\n","   -
